        <p>Praxi Data is a big data startup that has an automated data catalog pre-trained by experts. It accelerates workflow for AI model training and builds better curriculums faster.
        </p>
        <p>When the user needs to add a new term to the catalog, he will start a new term creation process, where the term name, description, synonym, effective and retire date, and some other conditions will be defined. We used to employ  the inspector panel solution for creating new terms. However this solution is no longer sufficient for future new term creation experience. So I redesigned the experience, the inspector panel was replaced with the <b>wizard experience</b>, in order to increase the capacity and convey our aesthetic and <b>minimalist</b> design.

        <p>
          Raven is committed to creating a <b>simple</b> and <b>effective</b> cloud storage product with a <b>user-friendly</b> and <b>minimalist</b> design. The product name, raven, represents the spirit of sharp, intelligence, and curiosity. A raven not only has the common character as other birds, the exploration of broadness sky but has high intelligence and an organized social structure. They work as a team. As you may know, ravens like to collect valuables and keep their belongings safe. All these characteristics let raven become the best representative of our product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo is an integral part of the Raven brand and should be used thoughtfully and consistently. The wordmark should most often be displayed in black/white with or without the logo icon. Our logo can be used either on its own or together with the wordmark which is based on the Damion typeface with the first letter in uppercase giving a sharp and energetic feeling.

        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p>
          After reviewed my personas again before creating the user stories, I put myself in the shoes of each of those user types and learned about what matters the most to them and what matters the least. Then I created user stories for the new user and return user, and ranked the tasks by importance. User story connects business concerns with the user research. It determines the order in which I will work on things and how long I will work on them.

          Transforming user stories into user flows is an important step before creating wireframes. I generated several user flows of the high-priority user stories. They are: create an account, sign in, create content, organize content, delete files, upload files, and share items.

            Before investing any time in the visual design, wireframes provide me with a map that can be tested on real people and great clarity into how information will be organized on the screen. The goal was keeping my pages simple, clean, and effortless to use. In order to pin down my final design, I first sketched those high priority features and pages with pen and paper. I also tried different styles of the homepage, dashboard, and the sign in page.

          I have created two colors for “update my account” button on the dashboard. <b>Most people (80%)</b> prefer the yellow button. Both of the colors are the accent colors, but with a blue background, yellow gives better contrast, and would easily draw users’ attention. As a result, I would change my original purple button to yellow.

          <p>
            The challenge I ran into was how to assemble the logo and wordmark together on Raven’s website. The combination of the logo and wordmark was not balanced, and there was not enough space for both on the top left corner. The wordmark had provided the sharp and intelligent feeling of this product with the Damion typeface. While I was not that satisfied with the logo. If given more time, I would have refined the logo design and polished it. It was not professionally designed. So I decided not to use the logo on my product, and only to keep the wordmark. It would be tested later.

          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Due to the backend technology, more content needed to be added to the form. When a new term is added, a series of questions will be asked after the matching step, and their formats are <b>checkboxes, select elements, or input answers</b>. The challenge for the design team is how to arrange the new content to guide the user to smoothly complete the new term process without being misled or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I split the content into two steps, one was “Define” and the other was “Locate”. In the “Define” step, questions were designed in different forms. To enable users to make appropriate operations, I divided the questions into three parts by the form logic.
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-point">
            <li class="li-text">
              Ture or False Conditions: Users just need to check the box to define if the condition is true for this term, such as the GDPR compliant and the PII data.

            </li>
            <li class="li-text">
              Selectable Conditions: This part consists of selected elements. Users select the applicable condition from the dropdown options. For example, the user needs to select the frequency of the term that is updated, which is weekly, monthly, semi-annual, annual, on-demand, rarely, or never.
            </li>
            <li class="li-text">
              Input Conditions: Users can type in their own conditions based on the requests.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <p>
            I created the full browser wizard experience to replace the inspector panel. <b>The electronic form is a direct descendant of the real world paper form: a page with empty fields that the user needs to fill in</b>. The wizard is the main application that takes the user through a sequence of forms. The step-by-step process allows users to input information in a prescribed order and in which subsequent steps may depend on information entered in previous ones. It is a good match for the new term creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>In the “Define” and “Locate” steps, the questions vary depending on the answers from previous steps</b>. For example, a new term under risk report class has a suggested status and high confidentiality, set in the first step, Business. It may only have two checkboxes and none dropdowns or inputs in the Define step. However, another term with low confidentiality might have more checkbox options, multiple dropdowns, and inputs. As the user enters information, the system computes the appropriate path for that user and routes the user accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because wizards split a complex process into multiple steps, the pages are simpler — they contain fewer fields and overall less information, which will increase the capacity and convey our aesthetic and minimalist design. Users end up being less overwhelmed by the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            More screen real estate is available for each step for the wizard experience. When a complex process is split into more straightforward steps, and each step gets a separate page, there is simply more space for each of the controls in a step. <b>Targets can be more salient and less crowded, and information may fit on a single screen. Items now have been grouped into logical zones, and headings have been used to distinguish between zones</b>. This is particularly evident in the “Define” step. The right side now has space for the helper text, which provides assistance on how to fill out a field.
          </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, done is better than perfect. I tended to get bogged down in details, focusing on the functionality of a part of the system, instead of looking at the big picture. I’m working in an environment where time counts. Both my time and energy are limited. I learned to apply this to my own work: creating cool results can be really simple, done in a few cycles and absolutely satisfy every single of the users needs. The deliverable successfully solves the problem, addresses the need, or conveys the message intended. Then I can prepare the next step and iterate.
