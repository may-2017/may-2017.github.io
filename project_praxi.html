            Time, effort, & cost spent
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We apply progressive disclosure to display the additional terms in the inspector panel under a new tab titled “Curated Terms”/"Suggested Terms". The curated terms that have been approved by a steward the earliest are displayed more forward, with search and sort features at top.
        </p>
        <p>We use the percentage number to indicate the confidence level of a suggested term, so the user has the first impression of it. A user should be able to click on any of these terms and “accept” or “reject” it.

        Based on the problem and frustration we found, we decide to improve the <b>confidence level</b>, <b>terms arrangment</b>, and the <b>data hierarchy</b>, in order to clarify and save time for the curation process. </p>
        <p>
        In order to gain more context and provide more friendly and efficient experience, I talked with the domain experts and the users. We found that in the old design, we are not speaking data workers’ language, “tags” can not represent “terms”. And the suggested term should be separated so the data steward can pick the right one to curate.</p>
        <p>We also need visual design to show confidence level of the suggested terms, so the user would interact with a high confidence term. Since there could be many of them, the sort and search features could improve the effectiveness a lot.</p>
        <p>And last but not least, we need to display children’s curated terms on a separate level to solve the frustration of Lack of visibility into the impact of different data levels </p>

          Raven is committed to creating a <b>simple</b> and <b>effective</b> cloud storage product with a <b>user-friendly</b> and <b>minimalist</b> design. The product name, raven, represents the spirit of sharp, intelligence, and curiosity. A raven not only has the common character as other birds, the exploration of broadness sky but has high intelligence and an organized social structure. They work as a team. As you may know, ravens like to collect valuables and keep their belongings safe. All these characteristics let raven become the best representative of our product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo is an integral part of the Raven brand and should be used thoughtfully and consistently. The wordmark should most often be displayed in black/white with or without the logo icon. Our logo can be used either on its own or together with the wordmark which is based on the Damion typeface with the first letter in uppercase giving a sharp and energetic feeling.

        <p>
          After reviewed my personas again before creating the user stories, I put myself in the shoes of each of those user types and learned about what matters the most to them and what matters the least. Then I created user stories for the new user and return user, and ranked the tasks by importance. User story connects business concerns with the user research. It determines the order in which I will work on things and how long I will work on them.

          Transforming user stories into user flows is an important step before creating wireframes. I generated several user flows of the high-priority user stories. They are: create an account, sign in, create content, organize content, delete files, upload files, and share items.

            Before investing any time in the visual design, wireframes provide me with a map that can be tested on real people and great clarity into how information will be organized on the screen. The goal was keeping my pages simple, clean, and effortless to use. In order to pin down my final design, I first sketched those high priority features and pages with pen and paper. I also tried different styles of the homepage, dashboard, and the sign in page.

          We made several iterations on different parts of the screens. Here is an example of how we apply the confidence level on the term.
        </p>
        <p>
        Suggested Terms are terms that our AI has identified by scanning the data in the data asset. Each term will have a confidence level associated with it. And the data steward will pick those with higher level. So the percentage is more intuitive, even though the Harvey ball has been used and exist in the design system, It only shows low, med, or high, which does not strongly convey the confidence score here.
        </p>
        <p>
        Based on users’ feed back, they more like to interact with high percentage numbers. 99% suggested is more appealing than a three-quarter Harvey ball.

          <h3>Review Chart</h3>
          <p>
            We use stars and bar charts to visualize the user reviews. The first thought was keeping stars and the chart the same color. However, our access green(#95E600) was too bright for large area use, and didn’t match well with our hyperlink access pink (#C909CD). The access pink has the same problem on extensive usage. So we pair the primary blue and the access pink at last obtained the balance and saliency.

          I have created two colors for “update my account” button on the dashboard. <b>Most people (80%)</b> prefer the yellow button. Both of the colors are the accent colors, but with a blue background, yellow gives better contrast, and would easily draw users’ attention. As a result, I would change my original purple button to yellow.

          <p>
            The challenge I ran into was how to assemble the logo and wordmark together on Raven’s website. The combination of the logo and wordmark was not balanced, and there was not enough space for both on the top left corner. The wordmark had provided the sharp and intelligent feeling of this product with the Damion typeface. While I was not that satisfied with the logo. If given more time, I would have refined the logo design and polished it. It was not professionally designed. So I decided not to use the logo on my product, and only to keep the wordmark. It would be tested later.

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>
            After several rounds of discussion and design review, we decided to take the following design approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            There could be a lot of the terms so we want to leverage progressive disclosure to display them. By default, display 10 - 15 of them. Provide a call to action to allow a user to “see more”. We display the additional in the inspector panel under a new tab titled “Curated Terms”/"Suggested Terms".
          </p>
          <p>
            The curated terms that have been approved by a steward the earliest are displayed more forward. Once the user views more in the inspector panel he can sort the view by A → Z, Z ← A, Relevance, Popularity (dependent on how much data has been tagged with the term).
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of a Harvey ball we use the percentage, so the user has the first impression of the confidence level.  A user should be able to click on any of these terms and “accept” or “reject” it.  If the user accept the term, it will be moved up to the curated terms section. If he rejects, another suggested term will replace the rejected one.
          </p>

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          Most enterprise applications are complex, scalable, distributed, component-based, and mission-critical. With enterprise tools, we are building products that help organizations and their employees do their work better. I’ve learned to simplify the complexity. Starting from brainstorming to stakeholder testing, I collaborate with other designers and product managers to design seamless experience. Instead of jumping straight into Figma, I took time to sort out the context and implications of what I am about to design. By reading data science materials and studying competitors' products, I have gained knowledge and experience of designing enterprise software and visualizing data validly.
