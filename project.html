        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>In this project, I created Raven, which is a simple and effective cloud storage product with a user- friendly and minimalist design. Raven lets you save, share, and enjoy all your files from anywhere. I am the designer of this project. I have used Sketch, Invision, Usability Hub, Draw.io, myBalsamiq, and several Google drive apps (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Forms, etc.) to complete this project.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The client would like to have a cloud storage which has multiple features:  save, organize, and create files, meanwhile collaborating with others. Thus, the main problem that I am facing is how to realize and harmonize those features in one cloud storage product. Additionally, those features have different priorities. This cloud storage product should split the primary and secondary tasks and features. </p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>With Raven, individuals could save, upload, and organize files for their own purpose. Saving the interesting links you find on the web, and sharing the Christmas photos with family and friends would not affect your collaborating with team members. All your team’s files are stored in the cloud so everyone on the team can access, edit, comment and share any of the files in real time from any device. With the simple and effective design, those functionalities are integrated with one product and can be approached easily by users. </p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>In the user research phase, I began with a user survey. One of the primary goals of this survey is Determining what features users actually want. The survey is also a great place to augment the competitive analysis by getting users thoughts on the competition. </p>

            During all the cloud storage products, only two have been chosen as the favorite. Users select either Google Drive or Dropbox as their favorite service.

            <li class="li-text">
            Most collaboration happens between co-workers, and they most often use collaboration tools (Slack, Asana, Google Hangouts, etc.) to achieve it. Email and cloud storage is the second choice.
            </li>

            Most users collaborate in real time only several times a month or even less often.

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The next step of a research phase is a competitive analysis. The techniques of competitive analysis can help me dig deeper into the current cloud storage market. It shows what the expected features are and illuminate areas of the market not being adequately served.
        </p>
        <p>
          I picked Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud to analyze. Through the SWOT analysis, I have gained a good level insight into the competitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Drive combines a set of office tools (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and etc.) with cloud storage in the drive, and is easily enabled to the existing Google account. Dropbox has a clean visual design. The mobile apps and desktop apps are beautiful and easy to navigate. However it only offers 2GB free storage, and after that user has to pay $10 per month for 1TB. iCloud has the reasonable pricing: 50GB for $0.99/month and a tight integration with Apple’s platforms. While it doesn’t handle collaborative editing as well as Google drive does. Though real-time co-editing is supported, a user can't see who's typing what.

        <p>
          Raven is committed to creating a simple and effective cloud storage product with a user-friendly and minimalist design. The product name, raven, represents the spirit of sharp, intelligence, and curiosity. A raven not only has the common character as other birds, the exploration of broadness sky but has high intelligence and an organized social structure. They work as a team. As you may know, ravens like to collect valuables and keep their belongings safe. All these characteristics let raven become the best representative of our product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The logo is an integral part of the Raven brand and should be used thoughtfully and consistently. The wordmark should most often be displayed in black/white with or without the logo icon. Our logo can be used either on its own or together with the wordmark which is based on the Damion typeface with the first letter in uppercase giving a sharp and energetic feeling.

            The primary colors of Raven include Dodger Blue, Raven Black, and White. The Dodger Blue represents the bright and intelligent essence of Raven. The Black and White provide the necessary proficiency and reliability. Our accent colors (yellow, purple, blue, and red) provide more ways to highlight and distinguish our product and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts.

        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p>
          After reviewed my personas again before creating the user stories, I put myself in the shoes of each of those user types and learned about what matters the most to them and what matters the least. Then I created user stories for the new user and return user, and ranked the tasks by importance. User story connects business concerns with the user research. It determines the order in which I will work on things and how long I will work on them.

        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>
          Transforming user stories into user flows is an important step before creating wireframes. I generated several user flows of the high-priority user stories. They are: create an account, sign in, create content, organize content, delete files, upload files, and share items.

            Before investing any time in the visual design, wireframes provide me with a map that can be tested on real people and great clarity into how information will be organized on the screen. The goal was keeping my pages simple, clean, and effortless to use. In order to pin down my final design, I first sketched those high priority features and pages with pen and paper. I also tried different styles of the homepage, dashboard, and the sign in page.

        <h3>User Testing, First Round</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted three usability tests of my low-fidelity mockups. My goal was to direct the testers to provide feedback about the overall user experience and how easy or difficult it is to the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
          <li>
            Signing up for an account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding a piece of content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Organizing a piece of content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Based on the feedback, I identified several items could be improved and some other items were approved by users.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-point">
          <li class="li-text">
            Limited text using is approved by users. The homepage is concise and clean, but need some enrichment, like more features, videos, and user testimonials.
          </li>
          <li class="li-text">
            Sign up process is smooth. No popping up window is more convenience and eye-catching, while sign in button would better be enlarged.
          </li>
          <li class="li-text">
            Keeping the design less distractive in order to help users complete their work efficiently.
          </li>
          <li class="li-text">
            Users showed the proper images they thought for the homepage. All images provide a professional working feeling, like a laptop, a cup of coffee on a desk, a notebook and a pencil, etc.
          </li>

        <h3>Preference Testing</h3>

The main reasons for choosing dark color are: This background looks more professional; The contrast and readability are better; It is concise and clean, which is a better match for a cloud storage website. The reasons people prefer the light color image as the background are: It’s vivid and fresh; It is trendy and more consistent with the rest color of the homepage; The balloons express a feeling of vitality and exploration.  My original design is the light color with balloons. I’d like to keep it for a better consistency and expression.

As a result, I would change my original purple button to yellow.

I personally prefer the blue folder, since the theme consistency is important.

            The challenge I ran into was how to assemble the logo and wordmark together on Raven’s website. The combination of the logo and wordmark was not balanced, and there was not enough space for both on the top left corner. The wordmark had provided the sharp and intelligent feeling of this product with the Damion typeface. While I was not that satisfied with the logo. If given more time, I would have refined the logo design and polished it. It was not professionally designed. So I decided not to use the logo on my product, and only to keep the wordmark. It would be tested later.

          <h3>Clickable Prototype & User Testing, Round 2</h3>
          <p>
            After the user testing and wireframe mockups, I created the high fidelity mockups followed the style guide, and another clickable prototype with InVision.
          </p>
          <p>
            I conducted 3 usability tests and received the final testing results. Users agree with that a cloud storage product would be better have a minimal and professional design. Limited text using is approved by users. The homepage is concise and clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colors are compatible. Dodger blue as a brand primary color successfully delivers the professional and creative spirit. Some enrichment is necessary, like user testimonials and footer, which I have updated in the finishing touches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Logo typeface is approved by users, while one user states the font size of this logo is small for the desktop screen, compared with the heading next to it. The balance between logo and content is worth to think over. Dashboard layout design is argued. Some users like the large thumbnails, but others argue that they are too large, and it could be better if put 4 images/previews in one row.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile screens sign in, sign up and forget password is plain and clean. One user prefers to add more details. However, we’d like to keep the page simple in order to draw users’ attention to the sign in/ sign up process.

        <h3>What I learned</h3>
        <p>
          I have completed this design project all by myself, from the research to the user testing. It is not an easy process, but I’m happy with the final result.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was most surprised by the fact that visual design was just a small part of the project. Throughout the checkpoint, the research and testing took so important places. The product improved after every time of user testing. However, if given more time, I would have refined the logo design. It was not professionally designed. I would have polished the logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          While doing the project, I learned the full process and workflow of creating a new product. For my future projects, I will try to separate each working stage with different priorities and use the certain time to complete each of them.
